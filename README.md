## Site Goals

- This website provides an overview of the **Africa Continent** in terms of **Land Size, Population** and **Gross Domestic Product (GDP)**. These measures have been provided in a **World** context. The website provides an ability to view similar data for each country in Africa by using a search function. The search function is provided at the bottom of the **'Home'** page and also on the bottom of the **'Country Details'** page. The search function in both locations allows for a quick search for an African country from either page.

- The website is **'informative'**, allowing users to view information about **Africa** and to view information on specific countries. The site is designed to show **Africa** in a world context on the **'Home'** page and to show each country in an Africa context on the **'Country Details'** page.
- The website concept is to answer high level questions about the **African** Continent;
  - where is it?
  - what are the countries in it?
  - where are the countries on the Africa Continent?; and
  - what size are each of the countries in terms of Land Size, Population and Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
  - what is the name of the Capital City and where is it located?; and
  - what does the National Flag look like?
- The answers for **Africa as a whole** are provided through a number of different media outputs on the **'Home'** page;
  - **text summary** on Africa land size, population and GDP
  - **a map** showing the Africa continent with many of the key countries shown
  - **line graphs** for population and GDP growth from 1970 to 2019
  - **pie charts** showing Land Size, Population and GDP for Africa relative to the Rest of the World.
- The answers for any **African Country** returned from a search query;

  - **text summary** on Country capital city, national flag, land size, population and GDP relative to the Rest of Africa
  - **a map** centred on the capital city location and showing the country in context of the Africa Continent
  - **line graphs** for population and GDP growth from 1970 to 2019
  - **pie charts** showing Land size, Population and GDP relative to the Rest of Africa; and
  - **pie charts** showing top five countries by Land Size, Population Size (2019) and GDP Size (2019)

- The website sources data from the **[World Bank Database](https://databank.worldbank.org/home.aspx)**. The website primarily makes use of Application Programming Interfaces (API's) to construct the country data, however in certain instances CSV files are used to provide summary level information. The **[Referential](https://rapidapi.com/referential/api/referential)** API via **[RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/)** is used to source country codes to construct country information and **[COUNTRYFLAGS](https://www.countryflags.io/)** for country flag images. **[Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/)** is used as a javascript library for **[Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/)** maps with **[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org)** tile data. API and other data source details are provided in the **'Application Programming Interfaces (API's) Used'** section below.

- If the site is perceived as successful, it is anticipated that the site could be expanded to show as;

  - there is a significant amount of data in the World Bank Database that can be utilised to expand the site. A number of data streams could be utilised to provide deeper insight at both the Africa level and the Country level;
  - other API sources could also be utilised to expand the information set;
  - similar information could be provided for the other remaining World regions; and
  - each continent and its countries could be expanded with more detail.

- The site is designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for interested users. The website was designed using **'Mobile First'** principles as the site must be perceived to be quick and easy to use and read as a reference site on a mobile device.

      ![alt text](https://readri205.github.io/MS2_Project/assets/images/userstories/mobilesearch10025.jpg "Mobile Search")

- ### Design

- #### Colour Scheme

  - The main colour is 'Ivory' (#FFFFF0), designed to provide a light neutral background to highlight dark text, line graphs, pie charts, images and the country flags.

- #### Typography

  - The "Roboto" font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case the font isn't imported into the site correctly. "Roboto" is a clean font which is both attractive and appropriate.

- #### Box Content Structure

  - The box content structure is used to highlight specific messages and themes through the site. This identifies the text high level summaries on the 'Home' and the 'Country Details' page. In addition the box structure is used to highlight the maps, the line graphs and pie charts on the 'Home' and 'Country Details' pages. The 'Contact Us' page uses the same box structure to present the 'contact form'. Each of the boxes has a shadow effect to lift them from the background and to provide a definitive outline for the contained information.

- #### Imagery

  - The header contains an Africa theme with a simple title. The large images in the carousel are designed to be striking and catch the user's attention and to provide some unique image themes from the African continent. To provide some context on larger screens each image has a clear title description sourced from the original image provided by the contributor. Note that on some screen sizes the titles can be difficult to read where they blend into the image. As the titles are not fundamental to the website information it has been considered 'acceptable'. On small screens the image titles are removed, due to space and readability constraints.

- ### Wireframes

- #### Original Wireframe Design (July 2, 2020)

  - The **'Home'** page includes an **'Information box'**, **'Population and GDP line graphs'**. On scroll down the page would reveal an **'Africa Map'** and an **'Information Table'** listing all 54 countries with their respective **'Population and GDP'** sizes. The **'Information Table'** is intended to be 'clickable' to search for more details on any Country. **'Country Search'** and **'Contact Us'** boxes are also included.
  - The **'Country Search'** page includes a **Country Name** header title with an image of the **National Flag**, an image of the **Capital City**, an **'Information Table'** of historical **Population and GDP data**, **Country Map** and **Line Graphs** of the same data. **'Country Search'** and **'Contact Us'** boxes are also included.
  - Sources for data were considered as follows;
    - Maps - [Google Maps](https://console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis/)
    - Africa country codes - [Referential](https://rapidapi.com/referential/api/referential) API via [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/)
    - Capital City, Population and GDP data - [World Bank Database](https://databank.worldbank.org/home.aspx)
    - National Flag images - [CountryFlags](https://www.countryflags.io/)
    - Line and Pie Chart Capability - [Chartsjs](https://www.chartjs.org/)
    - Automated Email Response - [Emailjs](https://www.emailjs.com/)
  - The **Original Wireframe Design** can be viewed here - [View](https://github.com/Readri205/MS2_Project/blob/master/assets/documents/wireframes/africa.pdf)

- #### Actual Site Design

  - The developed site uses many of the concepts from the original Wireframe design. Variations are as follows;
    - The main header image was switch to the 'Africa' header image which conveys a strong but not overwhelming 'Africa' theme;
    - The **'Contact Form'** was moved to its own page to **declutter** the two main pages. It is accessible from every page either through the main menu or from the footer;
    - The **Capital City** images were switch to dynamic **carousel theme** images on all the pages and placed just beneath the main header image. The images are unique and vibrant. If a desktop is left on the site, the images are eye catching due to **vivid colours** and the **carousel movement**;
    - The **'Information Tables'** were switched to more graphically appealing **Pie Charts** that are easy to read;
    - The **'Search Function'** remains at the bottom of both the 'Home' and 'Country Details' pages.
    - The above listed sources were utilised, except for [Google Maps](https://console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis/). The following were used primarily to provide a learning experience for the developer;
      - Javascript Library - [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/)
      - Imagery - [Mapbox](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/)
      - Data - [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org)

## Features

- ### Responsive for Device Size

  - Mobile / Smaller screen size
    - The site is designed primarily for use on a mobile. The 'Box Content' structure using Bootstrap Grid System has been utilised so that the information boxes (text, maps, line graphs, pie charts) will stack vertically on small screens for readability.
    - The menu system uses the Bootstrap 'navbar' functionality for small screens using the 'toggle' capability for the 'drop down' menu list from a 'hamburger' icon.
    - The navbar is 'fixed' to the top of the screen at all times on page scroll down for easy access.
    - The navbar is coloured 'black' to make it distinctive from the site pages.
    - The 'hamburger' is coloured 'off-white' to make it visible yet not intrusive when view the site details.
    - The 'drop down' site page options are coloured 'off-white' with the current page shown as 'white' and 'grey' background.
    - The header image and the carousel images are suitably sized for smaller screens.
  - Desktop / Laptop large screen size
    - The 'Box Content' is effective on wide screens. The Bootstrap Grid System allows for the 'Box Content' to align horizontally in themes that are consistent on each of the 'Home' and 'Country Details' pages.
    - The header menu system uses the Bootstrap 'navbar' functionality with the menu option pages listed to the left.
    - The navbar is coloured 'black' to make it distinctive from the site pages.
    - The menu item list is coloured 'off-white' to make it visible yet not intrusive when view the site details.
    - The 'drop down' site page options are coloured 'off-white' with the current page shown as 'white' and 'grey' background.
    - The header image and carousel images are designed to be larger and 'impactful' on the larger screen size.

- ### Interactive Elements

  - The key feature of the site is the interactive search for any of the 54 African Countries details returned on the 'Country Details' page.
    - Note that if a user goes from the 'Home' page direct to the 'Country Details' page using the 'navbar' menu, the default Country on the 'Country Details' page is Nigeria.
    - The 'Search' box is found on scroll down through the 'Home' page.
    - The 'Search' box is also found on scroll down through the 'Country Details' page.
    - In each case the user can open the drop down menu and pick a country of their choice. The search will return the details for that country on the 'Country Details' page.
    - The details from the search are returned using a various API sources. The details returned are;
      - First header text box;
        - 'Country Name' as a title;
        - 'Country Flag' as a colour image;
        - Name of the Capital City; and
        - Three text lines with information describing that country relative to the rest of Africa;
          - Land size;
          - population; and
          - GDP.
      - Second header box;
        - returns a map of that country, centred on the capital city. Note that the default zoom level is 6. The user can zoom in to see more country detail, or out to see the country in a wider Africa context.
      - Third and fourth boxes;
        - return the Population and GDP growth from 1970 to 2019.
      - Country Pie charts;
        - return land size, population (2019) and GDP (2019) relative to the rest of Africa.
      - Top 5 Pie charts;
        - return visual detail about the largest 5 countries in terms of land size, Population (2019) and GDP (2019) in Africa.
  - The user is able to contact us via the 'Contact Us' page.
    - This page has an interactive contact form that the user can complete and submit their details through to us.
    - There is an open text box so that the user can submit comments.
    - When the user submits their details by clicking the 'Send Contact Details' button, a modal pops up to confirm that details have been sent.

- ### Future Features

  - A 'quick search' will be placed at the top of both the 'Home' page and the 'Country Details' to facilitate regular users that wish to immediately see the details for any particular country as soon as they come onto the site.
  - Expand the site to include more details on the countries.
  - Update the API references for data such that the site 'maintains' itself when the World Bank Database updates the API data. Currently, some data is supplied via 'Manual Input' and 'CSV File' input which will require a manual process to update when the data is refreshed.
  - Amend the 'Home' page pie charts to ensure appropriate rendering on screen sizes at 280px size.
  - Social media icons link to respective social media website home pages. Social media links will in future feature link directly to RMC Ltd social media connections.

### Application Programming Interfaces (API's) Used

- The website sources data from the **[World Bank Database](https://databank.worldbank.org/home.aspx)**. The website primarily makes use of API's to construct the country data, however in certain instances CSV files are used to provide summary level information. The **[Referential](https://rapidapi.com/referential/api/referential)** API via **[RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/)** is used to source country codes to construct country information and **[CountryFlags](https://www.countryflags.io/)** for country flag images. **[Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/)** is used as a javascript library for **[Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/)** maps with **[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org)** tile data, but use the API data to return a Country map for a specific country in the search function.
- jQuery AJAX is used to load the API calls asynchronously.

  - [Referential API](https://rapidapi.com/referential/api/referential)

    - The Referential API (sourced via [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/)) was used to provide the country code to source all the country data in the search function. It provides the full list of countries in the drop down menu and on country selection, the country codes drive the other API's to return the required information. The Referential API is loaded with the 'Continent' denominator for the African Countries 'AF' (shown at the end of the link below). The API returns a full list of countries each with their respective two digit country codes (example: Nigeria='NG'). Please note that the API requires an Application Key so the link will not return a result. Please see the screenshot image of two countries' data, Nigeria (Key=NG) and Rwanda (Key=RW) as an example return (Note the API returns all 54 countries). The full API string is also shown below for documentation purposes.

  - [World Bank Database](https://databank.worldbank.org/home.aspx)

    - The World Bank Database was used as the primary source for the data in the site. The relevant World bank API's are requested for data once a user selects a country in the search function which drives the relevant country code. Once the country code is determined, a number of different API's are used to determine Capital City, Land Size, Population and GDP for the World sectors, Africa and the 54 African Countries listed. The World Bank uses a standard link to reach the core of its data (https://api.worldbank.org/v2/country/YY/indicator/XX.XXX.XXX.XX), where;
      - **'YY'** = 'Country Code' eg 'NG'; and
      - **'XX.XXX.XXX.XX'** = 'relevant data string for land, population or GDP data' - see below.
    - By way of example, the list below links directly to the API 'raw' data return for 'Nigeria', with country code 'NG' in the API link. The links below are also shown in full for documentation purposes;
      - [Capital City, Latitude and Longitude](https://api.worldbank.org/v2/country/NG), **https://api.worldbank.org/v2/country/NG**
      - [Land Size](https://api.worldbank.org/v2/country/NG/indicator/AG.LND.TOTL.K2), **https://api.worldbank.org/v2/country/NG/indicator/AG.LND.TOTL.K2**
      - [Population](https://api.worldbank.org/v2/country/NG/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL), **https://api.worldbank.org/v2/country/NG/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL**
      - [GDP](https://api.worldbank.org/v2/country/NG/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD), **https://api.worldbank.org/v2/country/NG/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD**
    - Note that not all countries have complete data in the API's either completely or for any number of years between 1970 and 2019. This will be evident in the line graph returns for any country. Sudan and South Sudan do not return any Land Size data in the land size data API. As this is the case, the Land Size numbers for [Sudan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan) and [South Sudan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Sudan) are sourced from Wikipideia and the Land Size total for Africa has also been adjusted accordingly.

  - [CountryFlags](https://www.countryflags.io/)
    - The Country Flags API was used to return the national flag for the country selected in the search Function. By way of example, the list below links directly to the API return for 'Nigeria', with country code 'NG' in the API link. The link below is also shown in full for documentation purposes;
      - [Country Flag, Nigeria](https://www.countryflags.io/ng/shiny/64.png), **https://www.countryflags.io/ng/shiny/64.png**

## Site Construction

- ### Consistent Page Components

  - All pages of the site contain the same 'header', 'navbar', 'carousel' and 'footer';
    - **Header** consists of a title image with hand drawn doodles and a scripted 'Africa'.
    - **Navbar** is a menu top bar that is fixed to the top of the screen even on scroll down. It has a black background with light coloured lettering. There is a light backdrop highlighting the page that the user is on. The menu allows for easy access to any of the three pages at all time. If a user selects the 'Country Details' page, Nigeria is the default country selected. On mobile devices, the menu becomes a 'hamburger' and muct be 'touched' in order to select any of the three pages,
    - **Carousel** Just beneath the main 'title' header image is a carousel of five images. These images are large and designed to create visual impact, especially as they scroll through from one to the other. The images are the same for all three pages. The images have been selected to represent 'Africa' but not necessarily in a traditional sense. Images of 'animals' and portraits of 'people' have been explicitly avoided.
    - **Footer** The footer is displayed on all three pages and is consistent. There are three sections **'About'** - describes 'us' as an organisation, **'Data Analysis and Presentation Requirements?'** - describes what we do, and **'Contact'** - describes how to contact **'us'** to discuss what we can do for **'you'**.

- ### Home Page

  - Information Box
    - Contains the details as to the intention of the site and a how it can be used. It also contains the basic information for Africa in a high level context.
    - The data included in the information box for the **World** figures is computed using the **worldstats.js** file for each of Land Size, Population and GDP. The respective sizes for **Africa** are computed separately from the World Bank Database Excel file download located [here](XX).
    - Note that as the World Bank Database does not show any Land Size data for [Sudan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan) and [South Sudan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Sudan), the values have been sourced from Wikipideia, and adjusted for Africa and the World Land Size Totals.
      ![alt text](https://readri205.github.io/MS2_Project/assets/images/readmeimg/informationbox10050.jpg "INFO Box")
  - Map

    - The Africa Map is constructed using the **africamap.js** file which uses the [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) library, based on [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) Map imagery and[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) data providers. The Map is centred on Ouesso, Republic of Congo (1.6155N, 16.0464E) in the Map Box.

      ![alt text](https://readri205.github.io/MS2_Project/assets/images/readmeimg/africamap10025.jpg "AFRICA Map")

  - Line Graphs and Pie Charts

    - The graphs and charts use the [Chartsjs](https://www.chartjs.org/) javascript library.
    - The Line Graphs and Pie Charts are all computed in the **totalcharts.js** file.

      - The Line Graphs reference [pop.csv](https://github.com/Readri205/MS2_Project/blob/master/assets/csv/pop.csv) and [gdp.csv](https://github.com/Readri205/MS2_Project/blob/master/assets/csv/gdp.csv) respectively to create the historical data between 1970 and 2019.

        ![alt text](https://readri205.github.io/MS2_Project/assets/images/readmeimg/pop10025.jpg "Population Chart")

        ![alt text](https://readri205.github.io/MS2_Project/assets/images/readmeimg/gdp10025.jpg "GDP Chart")

      - The Pie Charts are directly loaded with the data in the **totalcharts.js** file.

  - Country Search Function

    - the Search Function is a drop down menu that references the **getcountries.js** file. The country selection made by the user will return the required information about the Country selected on the 'Country Details' page. The **getcountries.js** file will return the required two digit **countryCode** that is fed into all the relevant API's (described below in the 'Country Details' Page section) that in turn generate the required returns for the Country selected.

      ![alt text](https://readri205.github.io/MS2_Project/assets/images/readmeimg/searchmenu10050.jpg "Search Function")

- ### Country Details Page (Nigeria has been used by way of example)

  - Country Information

    - Contains the basic information for the **Country** selected.
    - The Country Name, National Flag and Capital City is returned in the **countrystats.js** file from the relevant API's.
    - The data included in the information box for the **Country** figures and percentages is computed in the **countrystats.js** file for each of Land Size, Population and GDP on returns from the relevant API's. The respective sizes for **Africa** are computed separately from the **World Bank Database** Excel file download located [here](XX).
    - Note that as the World Bank Database does not show any Land Size data for [Sudan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan) and [South Sudan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Sudan), the values have been sourced from Wikipideia, and adjusted for Africa and the World Land Size Totals.
    - The following code at **line 107** in the **countrystats.js** file is used to account for Sudan and South Sudan Land Size data after the API from the search function is called;

    ```JavaScript
      function writeLandSize(data) {
        if (countryCode == "SD") {
            landsize = 1886068;
          } else if (countryCode == "SS") {
            landsize = 619745;
          } else {
            item = data[1];
            landsize = item[1].value.toFixed(0);
          }
          perc = (landsize / 295097.44).toFixed(2);
          document.getElementById("landsize").innerHTML += ("Land Size:   " + landsize + "   Sq. Kms" + " " + " - " + perc + "% of total Africa Land Size (29.51 Mn Sq. Kms)");
        }
    ```

  - Country Map
    - The Country Map is centred on the Capital City Latitude and Longitude. The map is generated by reference to the **countrymap.js** file which uses the [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) library, based on [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) Map imagery and[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) data providers.
      ![alt text](https://readri205.github.io/MS2_Project/assets/images/readmeimg/nigeriamap10050.jpg "Country Map")
  - Country Line Graphs

    - The Country Line Graphs are returned in the **countrygraphs.js** file from the relevant API's.

  - Country and Top 5 Pie Charts

    - The Country and Top 5 Pie charts are returned in the **piecountry.js** file from the relevant API's.
    - The following code at **line 18** in the **piecountry.js** file is used to account for Sudan and South Sudan Land Size data (in the Land Size Pie Chart) after the API from the search function is called;

    ```javascript
    function writeLand(data) {
      if (countryCode == "SD") {
        item = data[1][1];
        countland = 1886068 / 1000000;
      } else if (countryCode == "SS") {
        item = data[1][1];
        countland = 619745 / 1000000;
      } else {
        item = data[1][1];
        countland = item.value / 1000000;
      }
      const roaland = 29.509744 - countland;
    }
    ```

    ![alt text](https://readri205.github.io/MS2_Project/assets/images/readmeimg/nigeriagdppie10050.jpg "Country GDP Pie Chart")

    - The Top 5 Pie charts are computed in the **piecountry.js** file. Each chart for Land Size, Population and GDP references CSV files; [land.csv](https://github.com/Readri205/MS2_Project/blob/master/assets/csv/land.csv), [poptotes.csv](https://github.com/Readri205/MS2_Project/blob/master/assets/csv/poptotes.csv) and [gdptotes.csv](https://github.com/Readri205/MS2_Project/blob/master/assets/csv/gdptotes.csv) respectively.

  - Country Search Function

    - The Search Function is a drop down menu that references the **getcountries.js** file. The country selection made by the user will return the required information about the Country selected on the 'Country Details' page. The **getcountries.js** file will return the required two digit **countryCode** that is fed into all the relevant API's (described above in the 'Country Details' Page section above) that in turn generates the required information return for the Country selected.
      ![alt text](https://readri205.github.io/MS2_Project/assets/images/readmeimg/searchmenu10050.jpg " Country Search Function")
    - Note that the [Referential API](https://rapidapi.com/referential/api/referential) does not return the list of countries in full alphabetical order (mostly, but not exclusively). To place the country list into alphabetical order, the following code is utilised after the data is called (many thanks to [W3C Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_array_sort.asp));

    ```javascript
    data.sort(function (a, b) {
      const x = a.value.toLowerCase();
      const y = b.value.toLowerCase();
      if (x < y) {
        return -1;
      }
      if (x > y) {
        return 1;
      }
      return 0;
    });
    ```

- ### Contacts Page

  - The Contacts Page contains the 'Contact Form' for a user to supply contact information and to provide comments, questions or to provide a request for some work.
  - The 'Contact Form' will generate an email by referencing the **sendemail.js** file when a user submits their information.

## Testing

Testing information can be found in a separate [testing.md](https://github.com/Readri205/MS2_Project/blob/master/testing.md) file.

### Known Bugs and Issues

- Users may wish to know the full list of countries in each of the World Bank Database sectors listed in the pie charts on the 'Home' page. Future updates to the site will provide an appendix list for each of the sectors. The lists are provided in the [testing.md](https://github.com/Readri205/MS2_Project/blob/master/testing.md) file under the **Numerical Validation Testing** section.
- Mapbox and Country.io API requests can return CORS issues. The cookies submitted by these API sites have been updated with 'SameSite' = "None" and "Secure" per the [Google Chrome documentation](https://web.dev/samesite-cookies-explained/) by updating the Cookies in the Web Developer Tools in 'Application/Storage/Cookies'.
- To accommodate the pie chart rendering for iPhone 6 screen sizes (375px in portrait mode), the global default font size for the [Chartsjs:](https://www.chartjs.org/) charts is set at 8px for the 'Home' page and 10px for the 'Country Details' page. This font size is (in my opinion) too small for larger screens on desktops and laptops. Future site updates will look at other charting options to allow more flexible solutions to accommodate a larger variety of screen sizes.
- On some screen sizes at 280px in portrait mode, the pie charts on the 'Home' page can become squeezed and will not render appropriately. Testing on devices such as _Galaxy Fold_ (Chrome Developer Tools) evidenced this issue. Future site updates will look at other charting options to allow more flexible media query solutions for various screen sizes.
- On some screen sizes 320px in portrait mode the search menu text box sometimes squeezes outside the frame. Whilst aesthetically, not pleasing for the user the search function still works. Due to time constraints this function will be amended in future releases.

1. At the top of the Repository above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
   ![alt text](https://readri205.github.io/MS2_Project/assets/images/readmeimg/forking10050.jpg "Fork Button"); and
1. Click to create a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to **GitHub** and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Readri205/MS2_Project)
1. Under the repository name, click "Code".
1. To clone the repository using HTTPS, click the top right hand link click "Use HTTPS";
1. Copy the link under "Clone with HTTPS";
   ![alt text](https://readri205.github.io/MS2_Project/assets/images/readmeimg/clone10050.jpg "HTTPS Clone")
1. Open your Code Editor and access the appropriate process to paste the clone link;
1. Change the current working directory to the location where you want to keep the cloned directory;
1. Paste the URL you copied in step 4 above.

Note that different Code Editors will have different processes for making the clone once the HTTPS link copy is made in step 4 above.

- If using **GitHub Desktop**, the clone can de saved directly into GitHub Desktop from the "Code" dropdown menu by choosing **'Open with GitHub Desktop'**.

A **Zip File** clone can be downloaded from the same "Code" drop down above;

- Select **'Download ZIP'** and the complete zip file will be saved to you local computer.

### Acknowledgements

- My Mentor **Adegbenga Adeye**, (email: adegbenga.adeye@outlook.com, slack:gbenga_mentor) for continuous helpful feedback. Ade has been an amazing in helping and supporting me with this site. It has proven much harder and much more work for me to develop than I ever thought (severe case of 'what you don't know when you start').
- **Tutor support** at Code Institute for their support. When I have requested help, it has come quickly and efficiently when needed.
- **Student assessment** at Code Institute. I have looked to accommodate comments back on MS1 to reduce any re-occurring issues in MS2.
- **Other students** (Slack Code Institute Workspace) on the Full Stack Developer Course, via the [Slack Communication Platform](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/).
- **Peer Code Review** (Slack Channel)
  The website was uploaded to the 'Peer Code Review' Slack Channel designed to receive direct inputs from other developers. This provides useful third party feedback on the website;
  - @Dante **Dante Healy** for continuous positive feedback on the site usability and design and for testing the EmailJS service;
  - @Eamonn **Eamonn Smythe** for positive feedback and suggestion to include a margin around the maps to assist page scrolling on mobile devices and for testing the EmailJS service; and
  - @Jimlynx **Jim Morel** for his review and extremely positive feedback on the site.
- **Friends and family** providing review and feedback on the site content, navigation and screen size testing. This has been invaluable with two very 'have mobile, will travel' daughters, it is often brutal but effective.

## Version Control

- All through the development phase of the project, commits have been made from the GitPod Repository to GitHub. The version control list below mirrors the GitHub Commit list. It is designed to provide a direct track on commits in the README file for easy access as to code status in GitPod. Note that feedback from MS1 Project was received on July 8th, 2020 which stated that commits should be in the imperative tense. Any commits after this date (approx.

<b id="f1">1</b> **&** <b id="f2">2</b> **Future Features** in the [README.md](https://github.com/Readri205/MS2_Project/blob/master/README.md) identifies that a 'quick search' could be placed at the top of both the 'Home' page and the 'Country Details' page to facilitate regular and frequent users. Regular and frequent users may wish to immediately see the details for any particular country as soon as they come onto the site. This allows quick access to Country search rather than having to scroll down to the bottom of the page. 1[↩](#a1);2[↩](#a2)
